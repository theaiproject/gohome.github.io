Scope is important. I want to do massive stuff, but is that realistic? No.
Let's keep things simple.

Provide a guided story with branching decision trees about getting home through a zombie apocalypse from the office.

Program shouldn't print instructions. Things should be obvious enough.
Program prints introduction description.
Gives 2 options
Each option should reside in its own function, because too many if/else trees will be stupidly hard to read.
Each function should return nothing, serving only as a plot device.
There is no reason to separate them into different files.
There is reason to separate them into tiers. ie tier 1 is the main unavoidable story. tier 2 is the first set of functions from an original decision made in that unavoidable story.
I would like to write this in a language that is easy to use in this way.

C would benefit me, but it isn't fun to manage buffers.
Java is simple, and would work. It isn't very useful though.
Javascript might take a hot minute to configure properly, but would benefit me and is easy to use.
Python might benefit me and would be relatively easy to configure and remember how to use. It is simplistic though.


News articles on tv. You paid no mind. Just another distraction.
Go to work. Hate it. You're probably going to get fired anyways. Fall asleep around 2pm.
Nobody wakes you up during work hours. You wake up to the sound of clattering, your cubicle lamp the only source of light.

1. Gather your things and head towards the parking garage.
    You get halfway down the hall and realize you forgot your favorite thermos.

    1. Go back and get it
    Ben the janitor is snooping round your desk

        1. I really want the thermos
            Ben, the janitor, is oddly just hovering over your desk

            1. "Hey man, can I help you with something?"
            Ben flinches at the sound of your voice and turns to face you, revealing a grotesque mask of flesh. The left side of his face has been all but removed.

                1. Fucking. Bail.
                You bail. turning around, you sprint to the lobby faster than you ever thought you could. you hear squelching of wet flesh dropping to the floor behind you as Ben - or... what's left of him - shambles down the hall after you. You run past the receptionist's desk on your left and mash the elevator button furiously. In a panic, you remember there being a stairwell if you keep going past the receptionist's desk.

                    1. Wait for the elevator
                    You hear the familiar ding of the elevator's arrival as you see ben turn the corner of the lobby. The look in his remaining eye betray a supernatural hunger that turns your blood to ice. You jump in the elevator and hit the door close button hard enough that it cracks in your hand. You've never seen elevator doors take so long to close. You stand back as ben approaches...gaping his vicious maw and barking with a madman's ferocity. Just as the doors are about to close, the automatic sensors detect Ben and reopen again. You can almost see the grin where ben's face used to be as he sinks his mangled teeth into your throat.

                    2. Try to find the stairs
                    the elevator is taking way too fucking long. you make a dash for the stairs on the other side of the office just as ben turns the corner of the lobby. The look in his remaining eye betray a supernatural hunger that turns your blood to ice. you push through the crippling panic and dash through the cubicles on this side of the office - what you find brings a tear to your eye. turning the last corner before you reach the stairwell is another walking corpse - brenda, the receptionist in her business jacket and skirt ensemble - now red

                        1. Push past brenda
                        Channeling all the time you spend watching mma, you outmaneuver and charge past Brenda to the stairwell entrance. You close the stairwell door on Ben and Brenda and lock it just as they shove their gruesome faces up against the steel mesh reinforced window. you remember the floor above you is roof access, and you're on the 5th floor. The parking garage is B1

                            1. Go to the roof
                                A short climb later, you open the roof access door and greet the cool night air. The moment can't be savored for long. You see fires in the distance, parked police lights and with no police nearby, paper and trash strewn about the streets below, and hear the occasional blood-curdling scream as someone else falls victim to this nightmare

                                    1. Sit and wait... maybe jump
                                        The sounds of the apocalypse are oddly calming this time of year. At least you don't have to quit your job anymore. There isn't much left for you anymore though...

                                        1. Sit and wait... maybe jump
                                            If this is chosen 5 times, keep moving changes into Jump, and those are the only options forever

                                        2. Keep moving. I've got to get to my car.
                                            See below

                                        (3). Jump
                                            You walk over to the edge of the roof and step off. You relish the cool breeze for the final time.

                                    2. Keep moving. I've got to get to my car.

                            2. Go to the parking garage

                        2. Jump over a nearby cubicle wall
                        the cubicle wall collapses under your weight and you fall face first on to a desk. nose bleeding and head ringing, you stumble out of the cubicle into ben's arms, who greets you by ripping out your throat

                2. "Holy shit Ben - your face! We've got to get you to a hospital!"
                Ben's deformed face stretches wide as he opens his mouth like a snake before embracing you and tearing open your jugular

            2. Nod at Ben and bail with your thermos
            ben grabs your arm in a flash and takes massive bite after bite. you scream in horror as you pull back a bloody stump and fall to the floor. you never heard ben's undead moans over your own screaming as he fell upon you.

        2. Dodge Ben, the renderer of souls
        Deciding social interaction is worse than thirst, you continue to the elevator and press the button to go down to the parking garage. upon arrival

    2. Fuck it. I'll pack it up in my box of shit when they fire me.
    You continue to the elevator, cursing your boss for being a right cunt

2. Have a look around
You flick off the lamp light and peer into the darkness of the office, searching for signs of life. After letting your eyes adjust, you notice a figure slowly approaching your cubicle with an odd gait.
    1. Approach the figure
    You walk out of your cubicle and ask the figure what they're doing here so late with the lights off; however, a few feet from the individual, you stop dead in your tracks. Ben, the custodian, flinches at the sound of your voice and turns to face you, revealing a grotesque mask of flesh. The left side of his face has been all but removed.
        
    2. Call out to them
